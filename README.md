# Coupon Investigation

For my own investigation, I selected the Restarants(20-50) coupons for analysing the driver characteristics which have influence in the acceptance coupon decision  . I reviewed various factors such as the age, income, passenger type, and marital statis.

### Conclusions
1. **Age:** the young (under 30 years) and single drivers are who accept the most of this type of coupons.
2. **Income:**
   About the income, I analyzed the data by filtering in 3 groups: high($50.000 to $100.000 or more), medium($25000 to $49999) and low income(under $25.000).
3. **High income**: in this group the single and married partner accepted the most of coupons, which seems a normal behavour for them. Interesting to see the divorced people have not accepted this coupon in this group.
4. **Medium income**: the singles keep at the top of the coupon acceptance and then the married and unmarried are in the second place, both have a wide age range whichs looks like a normal behaviour.
4. **Low income**: again, the singles and young keep on the top of coupon acceptance.
5. **Passenger type**:  which accept the coupons have not passanger, they were alone.
6. **The of day for acceptance**: 7 AM, 10 PM and 6PM are the top 3.
